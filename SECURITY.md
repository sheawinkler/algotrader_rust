## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of AlgoTraderV2 Rust. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any proof-of-concept code or exploit
- Your name and affiliation (if any)
- Your GitHub username (if you want to be credited)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not receive a response, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Our Security Process

1. Your report will be acknowledged within 48 hours, and you'll receive a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.
2. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement.
3. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
4. Once we release a patch, the vulnerability will be disclosed in a security advisory on GitHub.

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we are happy to publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure, assuming you want the recognition.

### Security Updates and Alerts

We maintain a security advisory section in our [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/algotraderv2_rust/security/advisories). Please subscribe to updates for this repository to receive security alerts.

## Secure Development Practices

### Dependencies

We take the following measures to ensure the security of our dependencies:

- Dependencies are regularly updated using `cargo update` and `cargo audit`
- We use Dependabot to automatically check for vulnerable dependencies
- All dependencies are reviewed before being added to the project

### Code Review

- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review from the security team
- We use automated tools to scan for common vulnerabilities

### Secure Coding Guidelines

We follow these secure coding practices:

- Input validation for all external inputs
- Use of Rust's type system to enforce invariants
- Safe error handling with proper context
- Secure defaults for all configurations
- Regular security audits of the codebase

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as quickly as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.

# AlgoTraderV2 Rust Implementation Plan

## Notes
- The user wants to implement Version 0.2.0 of the `algotraderv2_rust` project.
- The primary goal is to get a trading-capable version running as quickly as possible by re-evaluating the existing roadmap.
- User has approved the re-prioritized plan focusing on a fast path to live trading.
- All code changes should be staged in git, and pushed after completing major tasks.
- The user has a specific persona they want the assistant to adopt: "ANARCHIST REBEL GENIUS MAD SCIENTIST".
- `OrderType::Market` is being used as the default for now during refactoring.
- There are two main `Signal` structs: `trading::Signal` (produced by strategies) and `utils::types::Signal` (used by the engine). Refactoring needs to happen in stages: update one, fix build, update the other, connect them.
- Codebase was reset to `HEAD` (v0.1.0) due to extensive errors from automated patching. Will re-implement advanced order types step-by-step.
- The `strategy_tests` feature flag has been added to `Cargo.toml` to silence `cfg` warnings.
- A dummy module `mod _removed_brace {}` was added to `src/strategies/config_impls.rs` to resolve a syntax error after removing the `tf_or_default` macro.
- The Jupiter price API endpoint `price.jup.ag` was failing. Switched to user-suggested `lite-api.jup.ag`. This is the v2 API, which requires token mint addresses (not symbols), returns prices as strings, and does not use the `vsToken` parameter.
- Initial attempts to pre-fetch prices in `lib.rs` caused compilation errors (`await` in non-async function) and were reverted.
- User has specified that hardcoded default/fallback values for prices are unacceptable; these have been removed.
- "Address already in use" errors occur if the previous process is not terminated before a new one is started. Processes can be killed with `pkill -f algotraderv2_rust`.

## Task List

    - [x] **Sub-Phase: `Order` struct and `execute_trade` signature updates**
        - [x] Add `pub order_type: OrderType` field to `Order` struct in `src/utils/types.rs` and ensure `pub timestamp: i64`.
        - [x] Update `Order` instantiations across the codebase to include `order_type` (default: `OrderType::Market`) and handle `timestamp`.
            - [x] Update `Order` instantiations in `src/lib.rs`.

        - [x] Update `execute_trade` signatures in `DexClient` trait, implementations, and call sites (`src/lib.rs`) to pass `order_type: OrderType`, `limit_price: Option<f64>`, `stop_price: Option<f64>`, `take_profit_price: Option<f64>`.
        - [x] Run `cargo check` to ensure build remains clean after `execute_trade` signature changes.

        - [x] Clean up `test_signal` in `src/utils/types.rs` to remove duplicated fields and correctly include all necessary fields (e.g. `order_type`, `limit_price`, `stop_price`).

  - [x] Implement portfolio tracking module.
    - [x] Create `src/portfolio/mod.rs`.
    - [x] Define `Position` struct (e.g., `symbol`, `size`, `average_entry_price`, `realized_pnl`).
    - [x] Define `Portfolio` struct (e.g., `cash_usd`, `positions: HashMap<String, Position>`, `total_realized_pnl`, methods for `total_usd_value` and `total_sol_value`).
    - [x] Add `portfolio: portfolio::Portfolio` field to `TradingEngine`.
    - [x] **Finish `TradingEngine` integration and cleanup:**
        - [x] Correctly implement `apply_trade_effects` in `src/lib.rs`:
            - [x] Ensure the core logic uses `self.portfolio.update_on_buy` and `self.portfolio.update_on_sell`.
            - [x] Sync legacy `TradingEngine` fields:
                - [x] `self.current_balance = self.portfolio.cash_usd;`
                - [x] Reconstruct `self.open_positions` from `self.portfolio.positions`.
            - [x] Update `self.daily_loss` using `self.portfolio.cash_usd` (or `self.current_balance` after sync).
        - [x] Remove all other legacy position/balance calculation code from `src/lib.rs` and ensure no stray code/comments cause compilation errors.
        - [x] Add `starting_balance_usd: f64` field to `TradingConfig` in `src/config/mod.rs` and provide a default value.
        - [x] Update `TradingEngine::with_config` to initialize `portfolio` with the `starting_balance_usd` from the config.
        - [x] Ensure `equity_usd()` and `equity_sol()` methods are correctly implemented in `TradingEngine`.
        - [x] Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` to ensure a clean build and all tests (including `tests/portfolio.rs`) pass.
        - [x] Address compilation errors from `cargo test` output in strategy files (`order_flow.rs`, `performance_aware.rs`, `mean_reversion.rs`, `trend_following.rs`) and `MarketData`/`Order` instantiations.
            - [x] Implement `Default` for `MarketData` in `src/utils/types.rs`.
- [x] **Phase 3 – “Make it Robust & Smart”**
  - [x] Add `strategy_tests` feature flag to `Cargo.toml`.

  - [x] Address `unused_macro` warning for `tf_or_default`.
  - [x] Implement strategy tests using the `strategy_tests` feature flag.
    - [x] Create `tests/strategies_compile.rs` for factory instantiation tests.
    - [x] Run `cargo test` to confirm all strategy compile-check tests pass.
  - [x] Implement basic UI/dashboard for monitoring.
    - [x] Add `dashboard` feature flag in `Cargo.toml`.
    - [x] Create `src/dashboard/mod.rs` with a stubbed Axum server.
    - [x] Add `pub mod dashboard;` to `src/lib.rs`.
    - [x] In `TradingEngine`, add an optional `dashboard_handle: JoinHandle<()>` and `dashboard_state: Option<SharedSnapshot>` fields.
    - [x] In `TradingEngine` startup, initialize `DashboardSnapshot` and spawn the dashboard server in a separate task, passing the shared state.
    - [x] Update Axum handlers in `src/dashboard/mod.rs` to accept and use `State<SharedSnapshot>`.
    - [x] Wire up `/api/portfolio` and `/api/metrics` to read from the shared state (initial read, not yet updating).
    - [x] Create `dashboard/static/index.html` with basic JS to fetch and display data.
    - [x] Update `root_handler` in `src/dashboard/mod.rs` to serve the static HTML file.
    - [x] Periodically update the `DashboardSnapshot` in `TradingEngine` with live portfolio and metrics data.
      - [x] Add a method in `TradingEngine` like `update_dashboard_snapshot(&self) async`.
      - [x] This method should populate `DashboardSnapshot` fields:
        - [x] `equity_usd` (from `self.portfolio.total_usd_value(&self.price_cache).await` or similar)
        - [x] `equity_sol` (from `self.portfolio.total_sol_value(&self.price_cache).await` or similar)
        - [x] `pnl_usd` (from `self.portfolio.total_realized_pnl_usd()`)
        - [x] `open_positions` (from `self.portfolio.positions.len()`)
      - [x] Call `update_dashboard_snapshot` regularly from `TradingEngine` (e.g., in `start_with_market_router` loop or a new dedicated tokio task).
    - [x] Verify dashboard displays live, updating data.
      - [x] Fix runtime configuration errors in `config.toml` to allow the application to start.
      - [x] Fix compilation errors and successfully start the application.
      - [x] Update Jupiter API endpoint to `lite-api.jup.ag/v2` and adapt to its requirements (mint addresses, string prices).
      - [x] Implement automatic wallet-to-portfolio sync to reflect wallet balance in the dashboard.
      - [x] Access the dashboard in a browser and confirm live data is displayed, reflecting the synced wallet balance.
- [ ] **Phase 4 – “Enhancements & New Features”**
  - [ ] Propose and get user approval for the next set of features.
  - [ ] Implement a robust backtesting engine.
  - [ ] Add support for more complex trading strategies.
  - [ ] Persist portfolio and trade history to a database.
  - [ ] Improve error handling and system resilience.
